## DLExercise
Deep learning exercise step by step
### MLP
Implement a simple MLP, mainly focused on the forward and backward propagation
### 20181002 CNN
A simple cnn network implemented with numpy, visualized with matplotlib, without forward and backward propagation.
Tested on the python 2.7.14
### 20181019 RNN
A simmple rnn network implemented with numpy.
The loss function is  cross-entropy loss(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross_entropy#Cross-entropy_error_function_and_logistic_regression)
##### Todo
* ~~implement the training process~~
